			<h2>MY HOBBIES</h2>
			<p>
			In life I love spending time with my friends: having a drink, shopping, eating out or even going to parties 🛍️ 🎉
			In my spare time, I also like watching Netflix 📹 so I never miss a new series. My favorite series is Gossip Girl and I think it's because of this series that I love gossips...😋

			<h2>MY PASSIONS</h2>
			<p>
			My first and most important passion is baking.👩‍🍳 It's a passion I developed as a child, thanks to my mother, with whom I used to make different cakes. After that, and over the years, I trained and learned on my own to make new things that are more or less hard. 
			My second passion is golf.🏌️ I've been playing it since I was 6. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to take part in competitions, but it's important for this sport to remain fun, so I've preferred to stop competing and play for pleasure.

			<h2>MY PROJECTS</h2>
			<p>
			My plans for the future are rather vague, as I don't know what I'm going to do after my studies. So my main project is to finish my studies, get my diploma and manage to find a sector I like for my future work😃
